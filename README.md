# üßπ Summer-Chores

This Code:You Module 3 Callback Assignment simulates a person completing summer chores with a chance of dozing off between tasks. This assignment helps demonstrate callback chaining, timing with `setTimeout`, and control flow in asynchronous JavaScript.

## üìù Description

Every Saturday, someone (like Joe) attempts to complete a set of summer chores. They follow a strict order of tasks, and while some are completed successfully, there's always a chance they might fall asleep from exhaustion along the way!

### Chores (in order):
1. Mow the yard (2 seconds, never falls asleep)
2. Weed eat (1.5 seconds)
3. Trim the hedges (1 second)
4. Collect firewood (2.5 seconds)
5. Water the garden (0.5 seconds)

Each chore (except mowing) has a **30% chance** of the person falling asleep and ending their work for the day.
